# Marionette/Rails Starter App

## Introduction
After digging around for quite some time, I found that one of the difficult things about getting started with Backbone/Marionette was that while there's lots of documentation on the Internet about setting up a rich client experience with Marionette and Backbone, there weren't a lot of good examples demonstrating how to set up the *full stack*.  In my case, I'm a huge fan of Rails (yeah, yeah) and Coffeescript, and it took a little finagling to learn how to pull in all my dependencies with Bower, initialize my application, and make sure that everything in my app "played nice" together.

This application is intended to be a demonstration of how to get all the separate pieces of your full application playing nicely together, in a way you're likely to see in a "real-world" application.

With that said, I'm not a TOTAL EXPERT.  Some things in this repo might not be The Best Way to do things.  It's just what seems most natural to me, and what works for me.  I welcome pull requests and constructive criticism.  :)

(I have to run, but I will extend this README with an overview of the app structure in future commits.)
